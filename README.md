[Memotion Analysis 2020](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20629) 

This repo contains the base code used Team KAFK for the Memotion Analysis Task. 
Since the data is publicly posted on Kaggle, we have released two notebooks containing the code for 
our classifier and exploratory data analysis at Kaggle itself. Please find their links below.

1. EDA Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/coseck/memotion-eda
2. Classifier Notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/coseck/team-kafk-classification-models-for-task-a-and-b
